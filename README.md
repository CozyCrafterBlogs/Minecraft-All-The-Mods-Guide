If you’ve noticed the lack of guides for All The Mods, you’re not alone, but I’m hoping to remedy that. As it has over 400 mods, I won’t be going over EVERYTHING, but I’ll go over some of the more important mods and their core mechanics. Some of these mods are very intricate and will require articles of their own, so the more I learn about them, the more I’ll write about them and update this article.

[This](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/85233/all-the-mods-10-atm10) is a list I found that contains every single mod in ATM10 (as far as I know).

### Thanks for reading!

As someone who is newer to mods, I understand how this modpack can seem intimidating. There is a lot to learn, but don’t be worried about learning everything all at once. My recommendation is to focus on learning the basics of 1 or 2 mods at a time, then decide if you want to get into more of the details or if you’re okay with what you know now. Remember, the most important thing is to have fun. Happy mining!
